# implement-hashmap

Implement a hashmap (with amortized constant time look-ups) in Python without using a hashmap primitive.
Please include an executable testing framework for your data structure.


To run the tests, please first `git clone` the directory and `cd hashmap`. From there, you can run `python linked_list_tests` and `python hash_map_tests` to run both sets of tests!
